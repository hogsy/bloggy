# bloggy

![Preview](resources/preview.png)

I wanted a really simple static blog generator, and couldn't find a good, easy, simple solution that didn't depend on a million of other things. 

This is a solution I've whipped up for my own personal use, hence why it's not really oriented towards multiple contributors, etc.

We should also add that this **has not been tested on macOS or Windows**, so you might encounter issues on those platformsâ€”but generally there shouldn't be any issues compiling for those if you so desire.

I'm making it public here just on the off-chance it might be useful to anyone else.
The contents under the [test](test) directory should give an idea as to how it all works.
